# Python Battle Game
Text-based battle game used to teach python object oriented concepts. It is being developed for illustrative purposes as part of the Freehold Computer Science Club.

Currently the focus is on exploring object oriented design, by creating different types of heros and monsters. These heroes and monster can then face off in the a battle, where the enemies (typically monsters) are computer controlled whereas the heroes are controlled by the user.

This is work in progress and will evolve over time.
